Because, if we do not use regularization data will memorize the training set and cannot predict test set very well. For further information check my machine learning tutorial. For this kernel dop not worried how to implement it, we will use sklearn. https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/machine-learning-tutorial-for-beginners\n",
